# Anjana Nandam — Professional Experience

## The Short Version
Anjana is a product and technical leader who builds at the intersection of execution, data, and user reality. With a Master's in Information Systems from Northeastern University and experience spanning AI platforms, e-commerce, and SaaS products, she moves fluidly between product strategy, program delivery, business analysis, and data-driven decision-making — turning complex, ambiguous problems into clear, shippable outcomes.

## Career Story
Anjana's career is defined by a consistent thread: she bridges the gap between strategy and execution. She started at Amazon, where she spent nearly two years mastering the operational side of product launches — coordinating QA, engineering, and product teams across 15 global marketplaces. That foundation gave her something rare: she understands *how* products get built, *why* programs go off track, *what* the data is actually saying, and *how* to bring all of it together into decisions that move things forward.

From there, she moved into full product management roles — at Trading Technologies, where she defined a 0→1 roadmap for a SaaS Execution Management System, and currently at Gabriel AI, where she owns the pre-launch roadmap for an AI voice outreach platform. Across every role, she's been the person who keeps cross-functional teams aligned, programs on track, requirements grounded in user reality, and metrics pointing in the right direction.

She completed her MS in Information Systems at Northeastern in May 2025 — a degree that reflects her intentional blend of product thinking, systems design, and data fluency.

## What She's Looking For
Anjana is open to product management, technical program management, business analyst, and data-adjacent roles where execution quality, cross-functional clarity, and user impact define success. She's drawn to environments building something real — where ambiguity is expected, data informs decisions, and speed without chaos is the standard.

She's based in the San Francisco Bay Area and brings both the startup agility (Gabriel AI) and enterprise rigor (Amazon) that makes her effective across company stages.

## Human Side
She leads with clarity — in meetings, in documents, in how she structures a problem. People who've worked with her consistently describe someone who makes complex things less complicated. She built communities from the ground up at Northeastern, which reflects something genuine: she invests in people and systems, not just deliverables. And she's the kind of person who earns two efficiency awards in a single year because doing good work, consistently, is just how she operates.
